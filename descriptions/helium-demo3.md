Log-in newly registered users from another stack
The steps are the similar as “Register users via a web interface” above recognizing that the authentication of stacks is based on OAuth with credentials common to these stacks. A Client_ID key, Client_Secret key, and Redirect_URL are provided on the RemoteStack. A “Login via CommonsShare” button is presented on the RemoteStack.  Selecting the button takes the user to the following URL for CommonsShare login: https://www.commonsshare.org/o/authorize/?redirect_uri=${ENCODED_REDIRECT_URL}&client_id=${CLIENT_ID}&response_type=code.  Once user logs in CommonsShare, CommonsShare takes user back to REDIRECT_URL and append a parameter code=${CODE}  to the end REDIRECT_URL/?code=${CODE} https://remotestack.org/hs-oauth/?code=${CODE}.  RemoteStack backend should extract this CODE and make a POST request to https://www.commonsshare.org/o/token/.  Note: this CODE has a very short life time. So the POST request should be made ASAP.  The response of this POST request is a json string contains ACCESS_TOKEN, and RemoteStack should save it on backend {"access_token": ${ACCESS_TOKEN}, "token_type": "Bearer", "expires_in": 2592000, "refresh_token": ${REFRESH_CODE}, "scope": "read write"}.  RemoteStack uses this ACCESS_TOKEN to access CommonsShare REST API (or cs_restclient).
