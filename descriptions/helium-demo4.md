Access restricted data based on an authentication system
A user authenticates in CommonsShare via an Oauth-based system.  Using the steps outlined in the “Upload and annotate novel data to at least one stack via a web interface” herein, the user similarly uploads secure data and creates a resource with Abstract, Keywords, metadata, and GUID.  The user may elect to make the resource Private to share only with trusted colleagues, Discoverable so the public may discover the metadata but not access the secure data itself, or Public that enables the public to both discover and download the secure data.  For this demo, the user selects Private.  The user selects the icon on the resource landing page to Manage who has access to the secure resource. A “Manage access” inset window pops-up enabling the user to add individual Users or Groups with “Can view,” “Can edit,” or “Is owner” access controls.
