# Argon Demo 5: Virtual Cohorts

*	Define a virtual cohort using DERIVA to identify a subset of data for a TOPMed analytic workflow, such as that defined in Demo 2 or Demo 6.
*	Create a shareable data identifier for the virtual cohort. The cohort would be accessible via resolution of prefix form using KC2-defined service interfaces.
*	Extract the cohort as a BDBag for processing by a workflow engine (e.g., Demo 4).
*	Augment the virtual cohort using DERIVA registration tools to include additional data produced by analysis of virtual cohort.
Relationship to other full stacks
*	Virtual cohort can be transferred to other stacks via REST APIs
*	Cohort can be indexed by other search platforms via export in Metadata Exchange Format as defined by KC7 (e.g., as discussed in KC7 document, BDBag) and identifier as defined by KC2 (e.g., a Minid)
