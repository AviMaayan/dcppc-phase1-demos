# Helium Demo 2: Register users via a web interface

* A new user without an account on CommonsShare goes to the CommonsShare
landing page and selects “Sign up now” or alternately selects “join
CommonsShare” on the Sign In page.
* Upon clicking either of these
links, the user is presented a form on the web page requesting the
user’s First name, Last name, Email address, Username, Organization,
Password, Password (again), and a CAPTCHA verification image/phrase.
The user fills out the form and selects “Join CommonsShare & start
collaborating.”
* Upon selecting that link, a message appears on the
page saying “A verification email has be sent to {the email address
the user entered} with a link that must be clicked prior to your
account being activated.  If you do not receive this email please
check that you entered your address correctly, or your spam folder as
sometimes the email gets flagged as spam.  If you entered an incorrect
email address, please request an account again.”
* The user receives an
email that states: “Welcome to CommonsShare. This email address was
used to request an account on commonsshare.org. If you originated the
request, please use the link below to verify your email address and
activate your account.
https://commonsshare.org/accounts/verify/f/4sr-dc98a07f2ea6d2bebbf4/?next=/
.If you did not originate this request you may ignore this email. The
CommonsShare Team.  Upon clicking the verification link, the user
lands on the CommonsShare landing page already authenticated for the
first time into their new CommonsShare account receiving a message
that they were “Successfully signed up.”
* If the user interacts
erroneously in any of these steps, appropriate error messages are
conveyed to the user so that the user may adjust and pursue the
correct course of action.
