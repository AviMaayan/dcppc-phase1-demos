Upload data and mint GUIDs on at least one stack to via web interface 
A user navigates to the CommonsShare resource landing page.  The user selects the appropriate typed resource, e.g. Composite.  The user then drags-and-drops one or more datasets via the CommonsShare Web User Interface and also enters a title for the resource.  The user then selects “Create Resource.”  CommonsShare responds back with a new web page indicating the CommonsShare resource with the data has been successfully created and denoting the newly minted unique GUID, obtained from a Minid service, in the URL of the browser as well as in the “How to Cite” area of the web page.  The newly minted GUID is thus registered with Data Commons global GUID service.
