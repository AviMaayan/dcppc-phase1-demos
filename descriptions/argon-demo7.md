# Argon Demo 7: Scalable, cost-controlled data analysis for purposes of data enrichment

In this demo we illustrate the ability to run a large computation over
Commons data, with cost controls, in order to compute derived data
that are then associated with the data for future use. Given the scale
of this computation, it will require a substantial allocation of cloud
credits.

*	Use DERIVA search on Commons metadata (e.g., TOPMed) to identify a virtual cohort of 10,000 whole genomes, represented by BDBag referenced by Minid.

*	Use computational profiles of variant caller to estimate cost of running variant caller on virtual cohort.

*	Run scalable consensus variant caller on virtual cohort.

*	Load derived data files into Search for subsequent discovery, and variant calls into DERIVA for future virtual cohort queries, along with associated provenance information.

*	Demonstrate browsing and search of  resulting metadata.

Relationship to other full stacks:

*	TBD.
