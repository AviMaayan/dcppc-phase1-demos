# Carbon Demo 4: MetaAPI: Deployed across selected APIs in the consortium

This demonstration will be for a MetaAPI that will be implemented
across selected APIs in the consortium. This MetaAPI can be used to
find and invoke any other registered APIs.

MetaAPI acts as a registry and mediation layer between domain specific
APIs Meta API will expose Data Commons resources and their associated
metadata annotations to provide a consistent, standards-compliant FAIR
approach to access these datasets and to create registries for FAIR
data objects Provide secure passthrough authentication mechanism is
being done so that resource specific authentication support can be
built into each Resource Interface
