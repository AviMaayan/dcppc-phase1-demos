# Carbon demo 2: Analysis and Training: Web Interface to access tools and sample code to develop analyses

This demo will demonstrate the ability of a researcher to access and
analysis genomic and phenotypic data in a collaborative analysis
environment. This user interface will provide the researcher the
ability to access JupyterHub/R notebooks to conduct analyses and to
find example sample code to assist with developing analyses. The user
can use the sample code to inform their own analysis; thus, providing
a self-training in the process.

Using authentication by an OAuth2 based framework, the user will use
their eRA commons credentials to login to the user interface.

User can conduct analyses in a collaborative environment 

User can have access to sample code to facilitate analyses
