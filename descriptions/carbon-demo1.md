# Carbon Demo 1: Web Interface to search subsets of curated phenotypic/clinical data

This demo will demonstrate the ability of a researcher to easily
search subsets of curated TOPMed-related data to inform and refine
research study cohorts and hypotheses. This user interface to allow
the user to access already curated clinical data to be able to explore
what is available and conduct feasibility studies without having to
write a single line of code.

Using authentication by an OAuth2 based framework, the user will use
their eRA commons credentials to login to the i2b2/tranSMART user
interface, as well as user interface access via JupyterHub to search
data using a Jupyter Notebook.  User will then be able to query
available TOPMed data, easily refine research hypotheses without
having to write code or access and/or download large datasets.  Demo
will include phenotypic data from Jackson Heart Study Cohort
