# Xenon Demo 2: Query metadata of TOPMed dataset and develop workflow for analysis. 

* Researcher wants to analyze TOPMed data with a workflow he/she develops.
* Researcher identifies files for analysis by querying the TOPMed metadata using the Data Browser (GUI) or the Datasets API.
* The researcher brings the selected data files to their workspace and then uses the Rabix software development kit, Seven Bridgesâ€™ open-source development and execution toolkit, to create a CWL workflow that can be run both locally and on the cloud, according to where the data are located.
* This user journey will be presented through a live demo of the UI and subsequently captured over a video that will be available to users on the FAIR4CURES Knowledge Center.
