# DEMO1: FAIR Workflow Portability (Aim 1)
Demonstrate that a workflow can be described, implemented, exchanged, and executed across multiple Full Stacks. 

Example: 
* Develop and register TOPMed workflows (TBD, likely in WDL and CWL versions), test data, and a test data concordance tool at a public URL (for example Dockstore.org, see example effort here: https://www.synapse.org/WorkflowChallenge) 
* Full Stacks implement a mechanism to retrieve a workflow definition in WDL/CWL from a URL, for example, the TRS API (GA4GH) provides a way to do this (see KC3)
* Full stack researchers can execute the workflow on test data and produce a comparable/same result as determined by the test concordance tool for the workflow
