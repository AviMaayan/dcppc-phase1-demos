FAIRness Assessment of test data sets
 
FAIRness feedback via score
The first 180 days simulated users (uploading datasets for the first time) will be given preliminary but real-time feedback about their FAIR-TLC score. For instance:
Findability scores will be higher for longer metadata descriptions, and when a data dictionary is provided. Interoperability and connectivity scores will be higher when standard vocabularies and proper bioentity identifiers have been used. Reusable scores will be higher when less restrictive licenses and when data exchange formats are used (where applicable).
Traceability scores will be higher when the provenance is documented and when any source data is properly attributed. Note that Accessibility scores will be high for all contributions by virtue of being in the commons.
