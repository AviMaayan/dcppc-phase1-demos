# Xenon Demo 4: Search datasets landscape and bring unrestricted data to the F4C platform for analysis.

* Researcher wants to discover datasets for a particular disease and bring that data to the FAIR4CURES platform for analysis.
* Researcher navigates to Repositive.io from FAIR4CURES platform and searches the dataset landscape (for unrestricted data) based on dataset metadata.
* Researcher is directed to the data source to access the data and then can upload the data to the FAIR4CURES platform (GUI or API) and use in an analysis. This user journey will be presented through a live demo of the UI and subsequently captured over a video that will be available to users on the FAIR4CURES Knowledge Center.
