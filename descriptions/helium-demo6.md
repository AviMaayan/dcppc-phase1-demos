# Helium demo 6: Upload and annotate novel data to at least one stack via a web interface

A user navigates to the CommonsShare resource landing page.  The user selects the appropriate typed resource, e.g. Composite.  The user then drags-and-drops one or more novel datasets via the CommonsShare Web User Interface and also enters a title for the resource.  The user then selects “Create Resource.”  CommonsShare responds back with a new web page indicating the CommonsShare resource with the novel data has been successfully created, and prompts the user to enter an Abstract and Keywords for annotation.  The user selects the edit icon to enter this information and annotate the resource.  The user enters the appropriate text to annotate the novel data in the Abstract text entry box and selects “Save Changes” when complete.  The user enters Keywords to add in the Subject area of the same page and selects “Add” for each individual keyword. The user may elect to make the resource Private to share only with trusted colleagues, Discoverable so the public may discover the metadata but not access the novel data itself, or Public that enables the public to both discover and download the novel data.  The user may choose from a list of standard licenses, but must pick one. The user can additionally edit the regular or add extended metadata in the process of annotating the novel data.
