# Xenon demo 5: Perform Analysis That Require Transfer of Data Across Multiple Cloud Environments

Researcher discovers dataset for a particular disease and analyzes data in one of the cloud environments on the FAIR4CURES platform using a task within project 1. Researcher then discovers relevant datasets on another cloud environment and performs analysis that combines output from the first task with inputs on the 2nd cloud environment using a second task in project 2. This user journey will be presented through a live demo of the UI and subsequently captured over a video that will be available to users on the FAIR4CURES Knowledge Center.
