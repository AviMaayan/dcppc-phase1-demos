# Xenon DEMO 1: FAIR Workflow Portability

Researcher wants to analyze GTEx data using a CWL workflow from another full stack. The CWL workflow has been registered on Dockstore. Researcher identifies GTEx files for analysis by querying the metadata using the Data Browser (GUI) or the Datasets API. Researcher ports workflow from Dockstore that was added by another full stack for analysis of GTEx data. Researchers can execute the CWL workflow on GTEx data on FAIR4CURES platform and produce a comparable/same result as on other full stack. This user journey will be presented through a live demo of the UI and subsequently captured over a video that will be available to users on the FAIR4CURES Knowledge Center.
