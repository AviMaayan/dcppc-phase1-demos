# Argon Demo 1: Secure and scalable access to cloud-hosted data 

We demonstrate how a user can access, and manage access to, NIH data commons data housed on Amazon S3 (e.g., TOPMed) via widely used HTTP and GridFTP protocols.

*	User authenticates using an institutional identity
*	User browses the data that they are permitted to access
*	User manages access permissions to enable access by collaborators (e.g., share data with others, share with a group)
*	User downloads, via HTTP, a subset of the data, for example to a laptop
*	User requests high performance, asynchronous, secure movement of data via GridFTP from Amazon S3 to a remote computer system (e.g., lab computer, Google Compute) for analysis.

Relationship to other full stacks:
*	It will be easy to integrate these same data access capabilities into other full stack solutions via the use of simple REST APIs.
