DEMO: Researcher brings their own data to F4C platform, analyzes the data, and mints GUIDs for the derived data.

Researcher creates a workspace on the FAIR4CURES platform to begin a new study with private data (genome sequencing data files). Researcher uploads private data to the platform using either the graphical user interface or the API. Researcher annotates the data files with metadata that will make the private files searchable on the platform and help ensure tools/workflows run correctly. Researcher sets up and executes a variant caller workflow and then selects to publish and mint GUIDs for the VCF files. Resulting GUIDs are registered on DataCite and VCF files are indexed on FAIR4CURES platform with the GUID included in the metadata. This user journey will be presented through a live demo of the UI and subsequently captured over a video that will be available to users on the FAIR4CURES Knowledge Center.
