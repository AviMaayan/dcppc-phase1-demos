Data Commons Pilot Phase Consortium, Phase I Demos
==================================================

GitHub repository: `dcppc/dcppc-phase1-demos <https://github.com/dcppc/dcppc-phase1-demos>`__. Please file issues at `the issue tracker <https://github.com/dcppc/dcppc-phase1-demos/issues>`__.

From the Project Execution Plan:

The demos are functionality that will be implemented in executable
form, usually as a Web site available through a Web interface or a
REST API. All demos will be based on a use of the DCPPC products in
combination with the DCPPC stack providers. Demos will always have an
associated walkthrough highlighting the current functionality (which
could be developed before or after the demo functionality). An
idealized example of a demo could be a stack-hosted Jupyter Notebook
that can use remote APIs to search metadata, examine metadata by GUID,
retrieve data by GUID, execute workflows, and mint GUIDs for newly
generated data and analysis results.
